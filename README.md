# Recreation of Kasa

I'm doing the recreation of an OpenClassrooms project : https://www.figma.com/file/E7yzU5Au4Qa4E056ej1Cfg/ARCHIVE-UI-Design-Kasa-FR-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev ,

To make this i will use ReactJS & TailwindCSS, datas will be in a JSON file as i'm concentrating mainly on frontend for now.

I will do my best to not make any mistakes but as it's probably not possible, i will later and as i code try to fix most of it.
